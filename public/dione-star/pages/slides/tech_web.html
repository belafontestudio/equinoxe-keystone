She was extensively modernised between 2011-2013 and now boasts every creature comfort you could wish for. Whether your dream is to island hop in the Caribbean, or make a trans-Atlantic passage, Dione Star will carry you in supreme comfort and safety.<br>The new owner spared no expense during the two-year refit, and worked closely with the original designers to make the yacht even better than new. With the Lloyds-class steel hull lengthened to 43.8m, there is ample accommodation for up to 12 guests, as well as the professional crew of 11.<br>Whilst Dione Star is styled and trimmed as a traditional sailing yacht, every system is a masterpiece of simple efficiency. She has a rugged 550hp engine that delivers a cruising speed of 11 knots, whilst the domestic loads are met by two powerful AC generators. Remotely housed in soundproof compartments, they power everything from the air-conditioning system and laundry to the stores chillers and desalination plants. Two skilled engineers and ample back-up systems are on hand to keep everything running smoothly.</p><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="clear"></div></section><div id="hslide1" style="background-image:url('/images/landing/IMG_0687.jpg')" class="hslide bg-img-slide"></div></div><div class="section section2"><div id="slide201" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#20" class="button active">The range to roam</a></li><li><a href="#21" class="button">Nautical mile</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> The range to roam</h1><p>Dione Star has a heavy displacement hull, which shoulders the sea aside without the need for an oversized engine. The 550 horsepower diesel and its soundproofed engine bay has been refined and upgraded, and the shaft is coupled to a variable pitch propeller for maximum fuel efficiency. Her top speed is 13 knots in smooth conditions, but she is at her most economical at 11 knots, where she burns just 55 liters an hour, half as much as at top speed. This itself is a very respectable return for a yacht of this size and complexity.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide202" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#20" class="button">The range to roam</a></li><li><a href="#21" class="button active">Nautical mile</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Nautical mile 5.000</h1><p>When under power, and with one generator running for domestic loads, there is enough fuel for a range of 5,000 nautical miles at cruising speed. This unusually long range gives tremendous flexibility for exploring remote areas, and for making sustained passages in complete safety. Better still, using the sails, can extend the range even further.<br><a href="#plan-modal" rel="modal:open" data-deck="1" data-pin="16" class="see-plan">See on plan</a></p></div></section></div><div id="slide203" class="slide"></div><div id="slide204" class="slide"></div></div><div class="section section3"><div id="slide205" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#30" class="button active">Ample power</a></li><li><a href="#31" class="button">Uninterrupted power</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Ample power</h1><p>Responding to modern demands for ample mains power afloat, and to provide the maximum comfort to the guests, the refit included the upgrading of the two existing main generators. The most efficient models available were chosen, and comprise two US-made 80kW Kohler units, and one 16kW emergency unit from the Canadian-based specialists Northern Lights. The generators are housed in two soundproofed engine bays, and as the yacht draws a daily average of 40kW on charter, only one main generator needs to be running. The second is used as a back‐up, or in case of maintenance to the first.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide206" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#30" class="button">Ample power</a></li><li><a href="#31" class="button active">Uninterrupted power</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Uninterrupted power</h1><p>Uninterrupted power is vital when supplying sensitive equipment such as computers, navigation gear and some communications systems, so if the designated generator falters, another kicks in automatically with no loss of service. The air conditioning and desalination units are similarly equipped, and able to switch between power supplies for business as usual.</p></div></section></div></div>
