When at anchor, there is a fleet of fast tenders, jet skis and paddle-boards at your disposal, along with ample fishing, scuba and water-skiing equipment.<br>As a base for any water sports, you could  drift  on the floating platform, fully sheltered  by a sun awning, dangling your toes in the water while enjoying a lazy brunch.</p></div></section></div></div><div class="section section3 loadImage"><div id="slide164" class="slide con-menu alone"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#30" class="button active">Cabins</a></li><li><a href="#31" class="prevent button">Resting</a></li><li><a href="#32" class="prevent button">Commodities</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Cabins</h1><p>Dione Star can accommodate 12 guests in 6 cabins: a combination of Italian design and simple refinement, happily recreates a mixture of the maritime feel of an old sailing boat together with the looks of a cozy childhood holiday home. The finishes vary between the cabins – some are trimmed in mahogany, others in natural bamboo, and the rest in clarified oak, but all maintain the style of a true classic. There is also a large opening porthole, giving guests a fresh sea breeze and closer contact with their surroundings.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide165" class="slide private con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#30" class="button">Cabins</a></li><li><a href="#31" class="button active">Resting</a></li><li><a href="#32" class="button">Commodities</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Resting</h1><p>Most of the sleeping accommodation is on the lower deck, and includes an owners cabin, and four guest cabins. Two of the guest cabins have a pair of single beds, but the rest are all doubles. Each cabin has it’s own en-suite bathroom and shower, whilst the owners cabin also has a sofa bed and study area. A sixth cabin for VIPs is on the main deck. The pilot berths behind the captain’s office can exceptionally accommodate extra staff or children behind a special partition.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide165b" class="slide private con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#30" class="button">Cabins</a></li><li><a href="#31" class="button">Resting</a></li><li><a href="#32" class="button active">Commodities</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Commodities</h1><p>With ample hot water, heated towel rails, efficient air-conditioning, and an array of dedicated audio-visual entertainment systems, guests will feel comfortably at home wherever Dione Star has travelled.</p></div></section></div></div><div class="section private section4"><div id="slide166" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#40" class="button active">Room to Mingle</a></li><li><a href="#41" class="button">Dining</a></li><li><a href="#42" class="button">Sunbathing</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Room to Mingle</h1><p>Yachting is a very sociable activity, so the redesign ensured there is now plenty of space for entertaining, both inside and on deck. The main communal area is the spacious lounge with an adjoining, fully air‐conditioned games center and dining room. This also has it’s own galley for the quick service of coffee, cocktails, and appetizers.<br><a href="#plan-modal" rel="modal:open" data-deck="2" data-pin="220,221" class="see-plan">See on plan</a></p></div></section></div><div id="slide167" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#40" class="button">Room to Mingle</a></li><li><a href="#41" class="button active">Dining</a></li><li><a href="#42" class="button">Sunbathing</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Dining</h1><p>When it comes to formal dining, guests can enjoy fine cuisine from the well-equipped galley in one of a number of locations, depending on the time of day, or the weather. The cosy dining room, for example, is fully enclosed, but to enjoy the great outdoors protected from the sun and wind, there is a large dining table under the bimini on the after deck. To dine completely ‘al fresco’ under the stars, there is another table on the open upper deck.<br><a href="#plan-modal" rel="modal:open" data-deck="2" data-pin="222,122" class="see-plan">See on plan</a></p></div></section></div><div id="slide169" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#40" class="button">Room to Mingle</a></li><li><a href="#41" class="button">Dining</a></li><li><a href="#42" class="button active">Sunbathing</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Sunbathing</h1><p>This upper deck also features a sunbathing and relaxation area of 35m2 with deep cushions, a sofa and comfortable hammocks.

When redesigning Dione Star to become his main residence, the owner wanted her to carry as many accessories as possible for the full enjoyment of each destination, particularly for keen amateur divers.  The new 4.5m hull extension, for example, now provides a diving platform and scuba station, with a compressor and 5 complete diving kits.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide171" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#50" class="button">Tenders and toys</a></li><li><a href="#51" class="button active">Tenders</a></li><li><a href="#55" class="button">Floating Platforms</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Tenders</h1><p>Helping to shuttle guests to each dive location, and to beaches and ports ashore, is a fleet of three tenders. This includes a 9.7m with a 270hp inboard diesel, a 5.8m with an 115hp outboard, and a 4.5m with a diesel-powered hydrojet, exceptionally safe in crowded waters. In addition, two 98HP Yamaha jetskiis that are housed in two tanks. Cleverly, these tanks can be filled with hot or cold water, either fresh or salt, to double as relaxation tubs.<br><a href="#plan-modal" rel="modal:open" data-deck="2" data-pin="27,26" class="see-plan">See on plan</a></p></div></section></div><div id="slide172" class="slide"></div><div id="slide173" class="slide"></div><div id="slide174" class="slide"></div><div id="slide175" class="slide con-menu"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#50" class="button">Tenders and toys</a></li><li><a href="#51" class="button">Tenders</a></li><li><a href="#55" class="button active">Floating Platforms</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Floating Platforms</h1><p>Another surprising accessory is a 24m2 floating carbon platform that straddles inflatable tubes. This can be moored near the yacht, or towed in to shallow water and anchored off a beach. As the yacht also carries a wide range of fishing and snorkelling gear, as well as paddle-boards and inflatable ’towable’ toys, the platform also acts as a base for water sports, or a snack lunch.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide176" class="slide"></div><div id="slide177" class="slide"></div><div id="slide178" class="slide"></div><div id="slide179" class="slide"></div></div>
