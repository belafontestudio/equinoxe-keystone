During the yacht’s two-year refit, he was keen to not only lengthen the hull and upgrade most specifications, but also to install highly dependable systems to allow the yacht to roam the world without constraint.</p><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="clear"></div></section><div id="hslide1" style="background-image:url('/images/landing/IMG_0687.jpg')" class="hslide bg-img-slide"></div></div><div class="section section2 loadImage"><div id="slide181" class="slide con-menu alone"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#20" class="button active">Maximising comfort</a></li><li><a href="#21" class="prevent button">Win-win solution</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Maximising comfort,</h1><p>safety and simplicity. The intensive re-modelling was undertaken by specialist refit yards between 2011 and 2013. Key to the transformation were two leading design teams, Diana Yachts, who originally conceived the vessel, and Nauta Yachts of Milan, Italy, who oversaw the redesign of the bridge, decks,  and part of the interiors.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide182" class="slide con-menu private"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#20" class="button">Maximising comfort</a></li><li><a href="#21" class="button active">Win-win solution</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Win-win solution</h1><p>The result is a yacht with a greater range, more dependable systems, surplus power and a larger internal volume.

The steel hull is now rated to the A100 Maltese Cross certificate, the highest possible standard obtainable, whilst the wastewater treatment, antifouling system, and engine emissions all comply with the strict Cayman Charter legislation. Coincidentally, these also meet the IMO’s (International Maritime Organisation) tough MARPOL convention for preventing pollution from ships.</p></div></section></div><div id="slide184" class="slide con-menu private"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu"><li><a href="#30" class="button">Highest standards</a></li><li><a href="#31" class="button active">Comfort</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Comfort</h1><p>Smooth running engines, quiet generators and purified water systems all help guests to enjoy their cruising grounds to the full. As such, the wastewater is fully treated before being safely discharged, and the fuel is also purified using Racor filters and an Alfa Laval centrifuge system to prevent stoppages. There are separators and collectors for bilge water and waste oil, to prevent even the slightest drop of pollution entering the clear turquoise waters of the Med, the Caribbean or the Pacific.</p></div></section></div></div><div id="slide185" class="section con-menu private section4 loadImage"><div class="filtro"></div><section class="center"><ul id="intro-menu-hide"><li><a href="#" class="button active">Intro</a></li><li><a href="#" class="button">Comfort</a></li></ul><div class="main-text"><h1> Home from home</h1><p>With up to 80kW of power available, and 28,800 liters of desalinated water on tap every day, Dione Star is able to treat it’s guests with all the comforts they would find ashore, and a few more besides.
